# EditorJs-On-Html

EditorJs-On-Html is a C#/csharp library tailored for Blazor web applications. It transforms System.Text.Json.Nodes.JsonObject that has data parsed from EditorJS into Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RenderFragments using the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Rendering.RenderTreeBuilder class.

## Why this name

The naming of this library, 'EditorJsOnHtml,' is a playful amalgamation of its core functionality. 'EditorJS' represents the block editor that this library interacts with. The 'JSON' component in 'EditorJson' signifies the data format used by EditorJS to define content structures. This library's primary purpose is to convert these JSON structures into HTML. As a result, the name 'EditorJs-On-Html' was chosen to reflect its role in facilitating this conversion process.
